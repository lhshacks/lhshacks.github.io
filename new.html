            VikeHacks is a 12-hour hackathon hosted at Lynbrook High School. All Lynbrook students are invited, and we will have workshops for everyone from new coders to advanced code ninjas!

            We are working to position VikeHacks as a small, concentrated hackathon and will have resources to encourage attendees to learn more about programming and computers.
